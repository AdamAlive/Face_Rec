<font size=30><font color=blue>It's a code using cv2 and face_recognition to track multiple faces.</font></font>

这是对视频的人脸进行逐帧辨识标注的python code。

I also make a writting function that writes the recognition results to a video by frames.
Here are the pictures that this python code shows:

 When it's written into a video, it seems like this:

Put the picture of a face into the same fold under the python code, and put the name in it and then it can be shown.
